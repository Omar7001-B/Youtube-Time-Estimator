# Youtube Time Estimator

Estimate the time in which you will finish watching a YouTube video! This browser extension, designed to work with Tampermonkey, calculates the expected time to finish a video based on your viewing progress and speed. It's a handy tool to help you manage your time and decide when to pause or continue watching.

## How it Works

The Youtube Time Estimator uses your current viewing progress and speed to predict the time remaining until the video finishes. It continuously monitors your progress and updates the estimated finish time accordingly.

## Installation

1. Install the Tampermonkey extension in your browser if you haven't already.
2. Install the Youtube Time Estimator script:
   - Click on the Tampermonkey icon in your browser.
   - Choose "Create a new script."
   - Copy and paste the script code from the repository.
   - Save the script.

## Usage

Once the script is installed, it will automatically run whenever you're watching a YouTube video. It calculates the time you need to finish the video based on your current progress and speed. A preview element will be displayed on the video page, showing the estimated finish time.

## Compatibility

The Youtube Time Estimator works with most modern browsers that support the Tampermonkey extension.
